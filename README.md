# Server I18n API

This is a server side only mod to provide i18n for server side only mods.

Language detection is automatically so players don't need to do anything.

**This mod is not needed on client**

## Guide for developers

You need to put language jsons in `data/<mod id>/lang/`, in vanilla assets pack format.

The only API is `ServerI18n.translate`.

For example: `Text.literal(ServerI18n.translate(player,"translation key"))`
